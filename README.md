# Analysis-of-several-Supervised-MAchine-Learning-Algorithms-on-Housing-Dataset
# <h3> Description: </h3> Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest based on their scores and regression metrics. Performed GridSearchCV and hyperparameter tuning to find out the best parameters and Linear Regression happens to fit the data with a greater scores and least mean absolute error. Given below are the graph and table to have a visual understanding of the regression metrics.
